*AJAX => ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT AND XML
The idea of Ajax is using these requests that we can make via javascript
asynchronously that's the asynchronous javascript to load some data
from a server or to send data to a server to save something to a database
whatever it is we're communication with a server behind the scenes not in
between pages loads.

*XML is a way of just grouping content and adding meaning to your data
