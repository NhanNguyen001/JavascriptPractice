Document Object Model or the DOM, it's is the heart of any kind of web page manipulation.

It's created by the browser when an HTML document loads inside it.

Once the HTML document is loaded in the browser the browser creates an object which models this document
and this object is called the Document Object.

Programmatically the document over here is modelled by this document object created by the browser and inside
Javascript code when we start to code we have access to that document object and we can use it to interact
with the HTML pages using those different property and methods.

DOM also describes how a document looks in a visual way too.
